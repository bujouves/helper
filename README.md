# Empty Project Template

This is an empty boilerplate for future HTML/CSS projects. Clone this repo to get started on a new project.

`git clone https://github.com/bujouves/start.git`

Now that we've cloned this repo, we'll need to set a new remote location. After creating the new repo, use this command:

`git remote set-url origin [add new git repo url here]`

Now push the new remote repo, and we're good to go!
